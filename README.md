# Proxy_switcher
I just created the script so that i could easily switch between the proxy on terminal.
You need to change the proxy according to the proxy provided by your network administrator.
Append the Proxy_switch file in .bashrc. please see and take backup of your .bashrc file before writing this file in .bashrc.
enableproxy will enable the proxy.
disableproxy will disable the proxy.
Current settings are 134.245.6.93:80
